# Double-Trouble
- case of improper input, reprompt for entry


Write a Java program (or C/C++) to play “Double Trouble”. Your program
should contain the input/output functionality necessary to have the user decide
who goes first and enter (only!) legal moves in alternation with the computer.
The computer need not play well but should declare a winner when appropriate
and then should terminate correctly. [15 points]
3. Write the necessary Java code (or C/C++) that will allow the computer to
make a winning move whenever such a move is available to it. You may do this
in any way you wish. It can be a stand-alone function or internal to the main
program. You may use built-in operators or design your own routine. [15 points]
4. Put it all together into a coherent package. The computer should win when it
has a winning strategy and should make random moves when it does not. Also,
the random moves should be independent from one run of the game to another.
That is, if you play in such a way that you win, the computer should not lose
the same way each time. [20 points]
5. BONUS! Go that extra mile and implement this with something beyond mere
text. Develop a GUI! Use colored sticks! I can’t think of everything. . . do some-
thing to impress your TA/grader/ME! [5 Bonus points possible]
Also, feel free to personalize your game. Have it play a best-of-(2n + 1) tourna-
ment, alternating who moves first or randomly deciding who moves first. Have
your program celebrate in victory or whimper in defeat. It may not cheat,
however. No springs, honest weight!
